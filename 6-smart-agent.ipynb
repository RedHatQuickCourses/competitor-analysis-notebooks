    "#### Custom Tool Calling and ReAct Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approach**: Use agents that can select and use multiple tools:\n",
    "1. **RAG Tool**: For questions about ingested documents\n",
    "2. **Web Search Tool**: For real-time information and current events\n",
    "3. **Custom Tools**: For domain-specific data (e.g., stock prices via APIs)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Agent Capabilities**:\n",
    "- **Tool Selection**: Automatically chooses the right tool(s) for each query\n",
    "- **Multi-Step Reasoning**: Can use multiple tools in sequence\n",
    "- **Context Awareness**: Understands when to use RAG vs. web search vs. custom tools\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates a comprehensive system that handles both document-based and real-time queries."
